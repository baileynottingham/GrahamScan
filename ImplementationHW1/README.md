Graham Scan Algorithm in Processing by Bailey Nottingham and Mario Hernandez

This program reads input from files described exactly in the spec. Some test files
that we used are given in the data directory. On the GUI the 'reset' button resets all
all the variables and displays the title screen again. The 'Read File' button displays
a pop up window asking for the name of the file. After a file is accepted it will display
all points in the file. The 'Sort' button sorts the points around the angle at which the
lowest leftmost point sees them, and displays every points new index. The 'Graham Scan'
button performs one iteration of the graham scan algorithm. The stack is displayed on
the right side of the GUI. The'Convex Hull' button shows the final results of the Graham
Scan and displays the stack to the right of the GUI. The 'Exit' button terminates the
program.

Thanks,
